# Tickety Enterprise
Tickety enterprise is the highest level we offer, with the most customization options available!

## Getting started
Enterprise is hosted by us, but on your own bot-application. This means that you will have to create one, or use one of your existing applications.
To create a new application, head over to [the discord developers page](https://discord.com/developers).
From here, you can click on the `New application` Button.

Here you will be prompted for a name, you can put anything here, it does not matter.

After creating the application, you have to turn it into a bot-application.
To do this, head over to the tab `Bot`, and click on the button `Add bot`. Then confirm.

On this new page, you can upload a profile picture, and configure the actual name for your bot. This one does matter!
I also recommend that you immediately disable the `Public bot` option, to prevent others from inviting the bot to their server.

Next you will need to scroll down, and enable the `Server members intent` and `Message content intent`. Tickety needs these to function properly.

Once you have made the bot, configured its name and set a profile picture, you need to grab the bot-token.
To do this, click on `reset token`, and then `Yes, do it!`.
The token will only be shown once on the discord site, so make sure you grab a copy of it!

Once you have this bot token, you can send it over to the Tickety Team, and we will set up the enterprise instance!
